1. To run the project please use a local server as XAMP/WAMP/MAMP
2. Also you have to initialize the json server.
2. I added the logic but there are a few validations missing.
3. To browse a song, please type in the search bar
4. With some more time I would used Yeoman or something similar to create the basic of the app and have everything running in the same place.
5. Please ignore this folder "node_modules/spotify-uri"
